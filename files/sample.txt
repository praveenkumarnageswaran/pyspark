PySpark is the python binding for the Spark Platform and API and not much different from the Java/Scala versions. A good starting point is the official page i.e Examples | Apache Spark. Python is dynamically typed, so RDDs can hold objects of multiple types. PySpark does not yet support a few API calls, such as lookup and non-text input files, though these will be added in future releases.
